# MVVM-Kotlin-Repository-Pattern-Android-Architecture-Retrofit
This example uses MVVM with Retrofit using Kotlin, Repository Pattern, Android-Architecture, Retrofit
# Kotlin MVVM Repository pattern

This kotlin Repository example provide basic mvvm MVVM using koin, Live data and Retrofit in Kotlin with gitup sample API.

You can find more information from 
- [Architecture Guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)

A sample app that display list of Git users. The purpose of this project to illustrate the usage of MVVM architecture design pattern that follow the best practices of Object Oriented Design Patterns using the following technology stack.
## Acknowledgements

 - [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) Model-View-ViewModel (i.e MVVM) is a template of a client application architecture, proposed by John Gossman as an alternative to MVC and MVP patterns when using Data Binding technology. Its concept is to separate data presentation logic from business logic by moving it into particular class for a clear distinction.
 - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
 - [KOIN](https://insert-koin.io/docs/reference/introduction/) A pragmatic and lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
